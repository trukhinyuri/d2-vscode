## Install

You can install using the extension sidebar or by going to the [Visual Studio Marketplace Website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=terrastruct.d2) and clicking "Install".

## Code Completion Features

The extension provides intelligent code completion that understands D2 syntax:

### Shape Completions
Type any letter to see shape suggestions. After typing `shape:`, you'll see all available shapes like `square`, `circle`, `cylinder`, `cloud`, etc.

For nested shapes, the extension provides full path suggestions. If you have a shape `Backbone` inside `Middle`, typing "Back" will suggest `Middle.Backbone` to ensure valid references.

The completion system intelligently prioritizes existing shapes over new suggestions. When you type "AIS" and there's already a `Middle.AIS` shape, it will appear first and be preselected, making it faster to reference existing elements.

### Connection Completions
After typing a shape name and space, you'll see connection operators (`->`, `<->`, `--`, `<-`).

### Style Completions
Inside style blocks or after `style.`, get suggestions for all style properties like `fill`, `stroke`, `opacity`, `shadow`, etc.

### Context-Aware Values
The extension suggests appropriate values based on context:
- Colors after `fill:` or `stroke:`
- Directions after `direction:`
- Boolean values after properties like `shadow:` or `bold:`
- Existing shapes after connections or `near:`

### Multi-Word Suggestions
D2 supports multi-word identifiers without quotes. The extension suggests shapes like `database server`, `load balancer`, `web server` without automatically adding quotes. You can manually add quotes if needed.

### Configuration
You can customize the completion behavior in VS Code settings:
- `d2.completion.enabled`: Enable/disable code completion
- `d2.completion.verboseMultiWord`: Show verbose multi-word suggestions
- `d2.completion.showOriginDetails`: Show inline details about suggestions
- `d2.completion.enablePatternSuggestions`: Enable AI-powered pattern suggestions
- `d2.hover.enabled`: Enable hover documentation

## Contributing

To package and install the extension locally, run:

```sh
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
npm run dev
```

You can run rerun `npm run dev` after any change to install the updated extension.

Sometimes VS Code will not pick up the new extension without being restarted so you
can also run the following on macOS:

```sh
# Where d2-testing is some folder in which you want to test the extension.
osascript -e 'quit app "Visual Studio Code"'; yarn dev && code ~/d2-testing
```

### CI

CI relies on Terrastruct's shared [CI submodule](https://github.com/terrastruct/ci).

To run all CI: `./make.sh`.

To run individual jobs:

- Format: `./make.sh fmt`
- Lint: `./make.sh lint`
- Build: `./make.sh build`

Jobs only run on changed files. To force it to run on all files, add `CI_FORCE=1`. This is
what daily job does.

```
CI_FORCE=1 ./make.sh fmt
```

### Packaging

```sh
vsce package
```

Upload the output `.vsix` onto
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/terrastruct](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/terrastruct).

### launch.json

We have a `.vscode/launch.json` that enables starting a separate debug VS Code with the
extension installed without affecting your existing VS Code instance. To use, open
`d2-vscode` with VS Code and hit `F5`. Press `CMD+R` after making changes to restart the
debug VS Code with the updated extension.

### Generating tmLanguage.json

To regenerate `d2.tmLanguage.json` after updating `d2.tmLanguage.yaml`, use [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/#install):

```sh
brew install yq
npm run gen
```

note: `npm run dev` will regenerate for you.

### Debugging Keybind

Highly recommend the following keybind for inspecting the textmate scopes under the cursor.

```json
{
  "key": "cmd+i",
  "command": "editor.action.inspectTMScopes"
}
```

### Offline Distribution

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix

```sh
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
npm run pkg
# To install:
# code --install-extension d2.vsix
# To uninstall:
# code --uninstall-extension terrastruct.d2
```

### markdown.tmLanguage.json

Syntax file used for markdown embedded within d2 block strings.

1. Copied from VS Code's markdown-basics extension.
2. Renamed to `markdown.d2` and scope to `text.html.markdown.d2`
3. Then with vim:
   ```
   %s/\(?:\)\?\^|\\\\G/\1(?!.*`\\\\|)(?:\^|\\\\G)/g
   ```

- This replacement ensures the markdown syntax never matches on block string
  terminators.

4. Then with sed:
   ```sh
   gsed -i -E 's/\[ \]\{[^}]*?\}/\\\\s*/' markdown.tmLanguage.json
   ```

- This replacement ensures that the markdown syntax doesn't consider leading spaces to be
  the beginning of an indented code block as in d2, block strings are indented for
  readability without the indentation being part of the string contents.

5. Now delete the `list` from `#block`. Lists for some reason eat the block string
   terminator. e.g. with them enabled the following syntax after the terminating `|`
   will remain markdown:

   ```d2
   my shape: |md
     1. first
   |

   should be d2 but VS Code highlights as markdown.
   ```

6. Add `fenced_code_block_d2` based on `fenced_code_block_css` to allow embedding markdown
   with d2 within d2.
